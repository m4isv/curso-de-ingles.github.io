	There was once a farmer and his wife. She had been
married before, her first husband had died, and now
she was married again. They lived on a remote farm in
the west of England, and what a pair of fools they
were! Which of them was the most foolish? Listen to
the story and decide for yourself.

	Jack looked up at the pale blue sky, and he said, “I
came from Heaven.” “My goodness!”, she said. “Did
you see my husband there?” (The farmer’s wife was
talking about her first husband, the man who had
died). “Oh yes, I got to know him well when I was
staying in Heaven,” said Jack. “And how is he doing?”,
asked the woman. “He is fine,” replied the old soldier.</p>

	“He works hard sewing and mending clothes for the
saints and angels, but even so, he sometimes doesn’t
have enough money to eat.” “And did he send me a
message?”, she asked. “Yes, he did! That is why I’ve
come here. He asked me to bring back some money
for him, so that he can spend his days in paradise more
comfortably.” On hearing this, the poor woman’s
heart almost broke with pity.

I’ll give him anything he wants! He’s a good man, God 
bless him,” she said. Then she went to the chimney 
where the couple’s savings were kept hidden. She 
took out two pieces of gold and five pieces of silver, 
which in those days was a lot of money. She handed 
everything over to the old soldier and told him to 
hurry up and give it to her first husband. “I will,” Jack 
told the woman, “as soon as I return to Heaven.”

When the farmer came back, his wife told him all 
about how a messenger had come from Heaven. She 
said that the man asked for money for her first 
husband, who was living and working in Heaven, but 
who was poor. “You are a foolish woman!” shouted 
the farmer. “How could you believe such a silly story?” 
“Well, you are even more foolish,” said the woman, 
“because you showed me where the money was 
hidden.” The husband did not agree with what she 
said, but he did not stay to argue. He hurried off on his 
horse to try to find the old soldier before he got too 
far away.

Jack Hannaford heard the sound of the horse behind 
him. He knew that the farmer was coming for him and 
for the money. Quickly, he came up with a plan. He 
knelt by the side of the road, covered his eyes with 
one hand, and pointed up to the sky with the other.
The farmer soon reached him and asked: “What are 
you doing here by the side of the road? Why are you 
protecting your eyes and pointing up to the sky?”“It is 
amazing! It is God’s work!” shouted the man. “I see a 
wonderful thing!” “What kind of wonderful thing?” 
asked the farmer. “A man is walking straight up to 
Heaven on a rainbow, just as if it were a road.

	The farmer looked at the sky, but he could not see the
amazing rainbow or the man walking on it. “Here,”
said the soldier, “kneel down by the side of the road
and look up at the sky like I’m doing.” “I will if you’ll
hold my horse,” said the farmer, and he jumped down
from his horse. As soon as the farmer knelt down, Jack
Hannaford jumped onto the horse and escaped! Now,
who do you think was more foolish, the farmer or his
wife?
